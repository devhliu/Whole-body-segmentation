# Whole-body-segmentation
Automatic segmentation of tumor lesions from whole-body PET/CT volumes using deep learning algorithms.
The goal of the project is to evaluate, compare and possibly improve various deep learning-based segmentation algorithms (e.g. nnUNet, R-UNet, ViT) dedicated to the whole body PET/CT volumes.
